# Colca Domes: Sustainable Architectural Visualization 🏔️

This repository contains a web-based application developed for OPIT. The project integrates modern web technologies to present a sustainable housing solution located in the Colca Canyon, Arequipa.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To build a high-performance, responsive interface that demonstrates the structural advantages of dome architecture in high-altitude environments, focusing on code maintainability and type safety.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering Decisions

* **TypeScript (TS):** Implemented to ensure rigorous type checking and to minimize runtime errors. All components and data structures follow strict typing standards.
* **HTML5 & Semantic Web:** Used to build a meaningful document structure, improving accessibility (A11y) and SEO.
* **CSS3 & Responsive Design:** Leveraging **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts. The project follows a **Mobile-First** strategy using Media Queries for seamless adaptation.
* **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is structured to facilitate future scalability and integration with backend services.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
* **Type-Safe Interfaces:** Defined models for architectural data and UI states.
* **Performance Optimization:** Efficient asset loading and clean CSS architecture.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Tested across modern rendering engines.
